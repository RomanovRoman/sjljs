2.)  For running tests with node:
    Run one of the following from your terminal:
     - `$ gulp tests`, 
     - `$ mocha tests/for-server`, or 
     - `$ npm tests` 
 
3.)  For running tests in the browser:
    - Launch './tests/for-browser/index.html'
    - **Note** `npm install` has to be run prior to trying to this aforementioned file.
